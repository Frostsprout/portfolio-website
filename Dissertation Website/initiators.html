			<h3 id="chaptertwo">Chapter Two: The Unique 'Other'-Selection of Other-Initiated Repair</h3>
			
			<p class="mini-headers">2.3 Repair Initiators</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">There have been several studies that have analysed certain repair initiators used by participants in a conversation – how a participant has had difficulty 
			with what has been said deals with the problem. Drew (1997) declared that participants would employ the form of using open-class repair initiators such as <span id="quote">‘pardon?’, 
			‘sorry?’, ‘what?’</span> to <span id="quote">‘indicate that he/she has some difficulty with the other’s prior turn, but without locating specifically where or what that difficulty is’</span> 
			(Drew 1997:71). This type of open-class repair initiator appears to be fairly polite; however, these initiators are very scarce in the data. The students did not use 
			any of these repair initiators out of 19 other-initiated repairs, and the sisters’ only used ‘sorry?’ once from their 22. This study was used alongside the data to 
			see if the relationship or age affected the distribution of this type of open-class repair and the results have shown that they do not affect the distribution, and this 
			is because the participants did not use these at all. However, it should be noted that Drew’s (1997) study analysed telephone conversations which are bound to have 
			many problems of understanding and hearing, therefore showing why the result is not reflected in the data.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Sixteen</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> He interviewed me and he said I'd good appearance…</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">DM4:</span> oh, right, //what kind of things did//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> //We sta-//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="strong">DM4:</span> you do there?</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(5)</span><span class="strong">BF2OI:</span> <u>Sorry?</u></p> 
				<p><span id="small-number">(6)</span><span class="strong">DM4:</span> What kind of things did you do in the office?</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Example sixteen is the only example taken from the entire data that uses an open-class repair initiator, and that is the use of ‘sorry?’ in line (5). The reason speaker BF2 
			asked this question is because she was speaking as speaker DM4 was speaking; therefore she genuinely mishears what is asked. What is interesting about this example is 
			that this open-class repair from speaker BF2 was not directed to one of her sisters, it was directed the male speaker who was recording the conversation and asking the 
			questions. The sisters’ did not use any of these open-class repairs, an assumption of because they are sisters they do not need to be polite to each other and would not 
			use these words. Speaker BF2 is being polite to speaker DM4 by saying ‘sorry?’ and having him repeat the question so that he can answer him because he is a stranger to 
			the conversation, and being polite is the correct way to handle the problem in hearing. However, speaker BF2 was also impolite in a repair-initiator to speaker DM4 early 
			in the conversation.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Seventeen</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">DM4:</span> Why did they give that to you?</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">BF2OI:</span> <u>eh?</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">DM4:</span> When did they give that to you?</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">In line (2) we see an impolite open-class repair initiator that Drew (1997) did not find. ‘Eh?’ sounds very abrupt and not as polite as ‘sorry?’ The use of ‘eh?’ 
			also prompts speaker DM4 to change his question word in lines (1) and (4) from why to when, this is perhaps speaker DM4 attempting to make it easier for speaker BF2 
			to answer back to. What is interesting about this repair-initiator is that it was used by speaker BF2 at the start of the conversation, whilst the previous example of 
			‘sorry?’ was used further into the conversation. Perhaps speaker BF2 was not comfortable with speaker DM4, and strangely adopted an impolite way of dealing with a 
			problem before a polite way to deal with the problem.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">There was another form of repair-initiation found within the sisters’ conversation and it was a partial repeat of the trouble-source turn. Svennevig (2008) commented 
			that there is a hierarchy for repair-initiators and the first is the least serious of addressing problems as hearing problems (Svennevig 2008:333) and then the other 
			problems not as easy to solve are problems of understanding or acceptability (Svennevig 2008:333). Example eighteen is a problem of understanding found in the data.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Eighteen</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">AF1:</span> And ye paid maybe thruppence or something.</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">DM4OI:</span> <u>Thruppence?</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">AF1SR: </span>And that was for towards the other ingredients, ye know, or a penny or what, //tuppence,whatever it was.//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">The problem of understanding occurs in line (2) with speaker DM4 specifically addressing what he is having trouble with (‘thruppence’). This kind of other-initiation 
			places <span id="quote">‘the responsibility on the repair initiator’</span> (Svennevig 2008:339) which means that they have made a failure in their turn, this could possibly constitute a 
			face-threatening act for the speaker of the problem. However, speaker AF1 attempts to offer information in line (3) however, she does not exactly repair herself well. 
			Speaker DM4 did not respond to the correction so it is not known whether or not he understood what was said. As before, this is the only form of problem of understanding 
			from the sisters’ conversation, and it is by the male speaker who is recording, therefore it could be said that the age of the sisters is affecting this repair because 
			the other sisters would understand what is being said in line (1) whilst speaker DM4 may be too young to know what a thruppence is.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">There were two examples of repair-initiators within the students’ conversation, example nineteen is a problem of understanding and twenty is 
			a problem of understanding and acceptability.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Nineteen</em><p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">DF4SR:</span> //King's Park// Secondary and then it was, twe-, twenty past four</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">BF2OI:</span> <u>Where's that?</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">	Speaker BF2 uses the question word ‘where’ in line (2) which Sidnell says is ‘specific in that they indicate what part of speech is repairable’ (Sidnell 2009:117) 
			which is correct as ‘where’ is indicating that speaker BF2 requires more information about ‘King’s Park’ from line (1). This example is not affected by the linguistic 
			variables; it is simply a problem of understanding due to not having the specific knowledge of what is being addressed. Svennevig stated that problems of understanding 
			<span id="quote">‘may be indicated by displays of incomprehension, such as for instance ‘what do you mean?’</span> (Svennevig 2008:336) and this is replicated in this example. The second example
			found in the students’ conversation has a mix between understanding and acceptability.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Twenty</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">CF3:</span> //Do you remember// //Keepers?//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">DF4:</span> //[inaudible]//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">AM1:</span> //Yeah.//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> I remember them, definitely.</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(5)</span><span class="strong">DF4OI:</span> <u>Finders keepers?</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(6)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> //Keepers and//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(7)</span><span class="strong">CF3:</span> //Uh-huh// //And do you remember?//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(8)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> //it was like you got them in all// different, I had //My Little Pony//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(9)</span><span class="strong">DF4:</span> //uh-huh//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">This example demonstrates slight social epistemics because the discussion is asking for the participants to remember a certain game that was available to them 
			(the knowledge being affected by their age group) however line (1) does not contain a repair-initiator of a question word looking for more information, it is simply 
			speaker CF3 wanting to start a discussion on this game which is why it is not an example of social epistemics. However, the problem lies on whether or not the 
			repair-initiation of line (4) is of understanding or of acceptability. Sidnell (2009) stated that a repair-initiator could be <span id="quote">‘a partial repeat of the trouble-source 
			turn, plus a question word’</span> (Sidnell 2009:368), in line (4) there is the partial repeat of ‘keepers’ but there is not a question word, instead speaker DF4 has included 
			a partial repeat and the word ‘finders’. There is a problem of understanding because it seems speaker DF4 does not understand what ‘keepers’ is exactly referring to and
			is wanting to make it more specific so that he can understand. Line (7) shows the confirmation of line (4) and line (9) shows that speaker DF4 accepts the confirmation 
			and understands which allows the conversation to progress.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">It was thought that these types of repair-initiators analysed by Drew (1997) and Svennevig (2008) would have been affected by the linguistic variables, but there 
			simply was just not enough examples found in the data to support this hypothesis. Out of the few examples found, only a few of them could be seen to be affected by 
			the linguistic variables – relationship allowing the sisters to not use open-class repair initiators and only to the male speaker, and age affecting the understanding 
			of the word ‘thruppence’ for the sisters and the understanding of ‘keepers’ from the students. Possibly following Drew’s (1997) study of analysing telephone 
			conversations would have a better confirmation to see if linguistic variables are affecting repair-initiators, but because the data of this dissertation is face-to-face,
			problems of hearing do not appear to happen as often as they would by telephone.</p>
