			<p><strong><u>2.1 Social Epistemics</u></strong></p>
			
			<p>Searching for examples of social epistemics in each conversation was rather difficult because each conversation was given a specific topic to discuss – the sister’s 
			discussed life experiences and the students discussed music and festivals. Therefore, all the participants were already going to be drawing on their own knowledge to 
			answer the specific topic. This has the advantage of showing that with the sisters, their relationship as siblings does affect the distribution of knowledge because 
			they have shared these specific life experiences together whilst the students have not had life experiences together so they do not have the same knowledge and cannot 
			rely on the other to correct them if the information is wrong which will be explained in the examples shortly. However, the students have the advantage of being roughly 
			the same age, some of their discussion asks for them to remember toys from their childhood and this affects the distribution of knowledge in the conversation.</p>
			
			<p>Due to the specific topic discussions, Bolden’s (2011) statement of ‘when somebody talks about experiences of a copresent participant, that participant retains a
			privileged access to what is being said […] s/he is expected to confirm (deny/or elaborate on) what is being said on his/her behalf (Bolden 2011:253) was kept in mind 
			in accordance with the data, so the examples that were chosen from both conversations had to have a participant ask a question to confirm if what is said is correct in 
			order to avoid the problem of the specific topic discussion skewing the data.</p>
			
			<p>Bolden (2011) explained ‘the most obvious finding of this study is that ‘other’-selection in other-initiated repair is very rare’ (Bolden 2011:239), this point is 
			also reflected in the data of this dissertation because from the 22 other-initiated repair examples collected from the sister’s conversation, only three of these 
			contained social epistemics. And from the 19 examples of other-initiated repairs in the student conversation, only two of them contained social epistemics. Bolden 
			(2011) also showed in their analysis that ‘selecting somebody other than the speaker of the trouble-source turn to provide a repair solution, the repair initiator 
			orients to two very general considerations (sometimes concurrently): (a) maintaining progressivity of talk, and (b) respecting or implementing socially distributed 
			rights to knowledge (social epistemics)’ (Bolden 2011:239). This result is also reflected in the data. The examples of social epistemics from the sister’s conversation 
			will be analysed first.</p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p>(1)AF1: She hated it, but //that teacher wisnae//</p>
				<p>(2)BF2: //I don't know why.//</p>
				<p>(3)AF1OI: good tae ye, she wisnae good tae ye, was she?</p>
				<p>(4)BF2OI: Who?</p>
				<p>(5)AF1SROR: That f- teacher ye had in the junior school.</p>
				<p>(6)BF2: Miss [CENSORED: surname]?</p> 
				<p>(7)AF1: Aye.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>	This example demonstrates that the variable of relationship is affecting the repair because the subject of this example is sister AF1 discussing sister BF2’s 
			experience in school. The ‘other’-selection other-initiated repair appears in line (3) where speaker AF1 is deliberately selecting speaker BF2 to confirm whether or 
			not what she is saying is correct because speaker BF2 has the ‘right’ (Bolden 2011:248) to confirm. However, line (4) has another other-initiated repair, specifically 
			an open-class repair initiator of ‘who?’ speaker AF1 replies in line (5) with further knowledge of speaker BF2’s past experience – relationship is affecting the repair 
			– and line (6) shows an answer given to which line (7) shows the confirmation. This example is incredibly interesting because speaker BF2 is the one with the ‘right’ 
			(Bolden 2011:248) to confirm her own past experiences, but her sister, speaker AF1, appears to be the one with the knowledge as even she confirms the answer of line (6).
			This example is demonstrating that relationship is affecting this repair through social epistemics.</p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p>(1)BF2: //Ye'd tae go tae Ayr Academy// [inaudible] //cookery.///</p>
				<p>(2)AF1OR: //No.// No, you went, //we had, we//</p>
				<p>(3)BF2SR: //I did!//</p>
				<p>(4)AF1OI: had a cookery cla-, a cookery bit under the clinic, remember? </p>
				<p>(5)BF2SR: oh right, we went for laundry //to that Ayr Academy.//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>	This is another example of two participants producing repairs because of social epistemics. The ‘other’-selected other-initiation takes place within line (1) and 
			line (4), however Bolden (2011) argues that ‘the repair initiation selects that person – and not the speaker of the trouble source turn’ (Bolden 2011:253) and this is 
			not reflected through this example – speaker AF1 can truly only ask speaker BF2 for the confirmation, even though she is the one who has created the problem, because 
			speaker BF2 is the one with the ‘right’ (Bolden 2011:248) to confirm if what is being said is true, even though speaker AF1 also has this knowledge. This again also 
			shows that relationship is affecting repair with social epistemics, speaker AF1 knows that her sister has the knowledge of what is being discussed therefore she is the 
			only one who can confirm this, and she selects her by giving her information in line (4) and asking her to remember. Line (5) also has a self-repair in the preferred 
			position, speaker AF1 allowed her sister to repair herself.</p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p>(1)BF2OI: What did ye call them that used tae live next door tae us? //Her that had the bendy//bottle at New Year. The bendy</p>
				<p>(2)CF3OR: Wilson?</p>
				<p>(3)BF2: W- was it</p>
				<p>(4)AF1: uh-huh</p>
				<p>(5)BF2OI: was it Wilson or Gibson?</p>
				<p>(6)CF3OR: Cairns?</p>
				<p>(7)BF2: Cairns! An his father had, I'd tae dump it in at somebody's house, and he took me tae Gray's on the bar o his bicycle that morning, so as I'd be in time 
				for my work.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>The final example from the sister’s conversation shows all three sisters engaging in the topic, drawing on their own knowledge of their past. Line (1) contains the 
			‘other’-selection other-initiated repair, however a specific person is not identified, and the repair is open to anyone willing to contribute. However, the question is 
			very specific, therefore the other two sisters are going to be the ones with the knowledge to repair – relationship is affecting the repair in this example because 
			speaker BF2 knows that she and her sisters have the same shared experience of living in the same house, therefore any of them will know the answer which is why she has 
			not specifically selected one. Speaker CF3 offers a repair in line (2) which speaker AF1 agrees with in line (4). However, speaker BF2 is not happy with the selection 
			and uses her own knowledge to give another other-initiated repair in line (5) which is then given an answer in line (6). This example shows all three participants of 
			the conversation using their own knowledge to help with the progressivity of the conversation, and also shows that relationship is affecting the repair.</p>
			
			<p>The students’ conversation contains two examples of social epistemics, the first example is very similar to the sisters’, but instead of relationship affecting the 
			repair, it is the age variable. </p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p>(1)AM1OI: //Remember, what did you call it, that//</p>
				<p>(2)CF3: //With some lots, with some nice E numbers in it, get you hi-//</p>
				<p>(3)AM1OI: other drink thing?</p>
				<p>(4)DF4OR: Stream, Stream //Sodastream.//</p>
				<p>(5)AM1OR: //Sodastream. It was just like//</p>
				<p>(6)BF2OR: //Sodastream./</p>
				<p>(7)CF3OR: //Sodastream, I had one of them// //in my house. I loved it!//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>The other-initiated repair is given in line (1), no one is selected to other-repair (Bolden 2011:253), instead it is an open class other-initiation but speaker 
			AM1 is asking a specific question. Social epistemics appears to be involved in this repair, especially as all of the other participants understand what speaker AM1 
			is talking about, therefore they all at the same time offer an other-repair in lines (4), (5), (6), and (7), and speaker AM1 also confirms the repair and uses the
			answer in line (5).  Age does appear to be playing a role and affecting the many other-repairs given in this example because each speaker has the epistemic rights of 
			giving this repair because they all understand what speaker AM1 is talking about – the age variable appears to be that because they are all of similar ages, they all 
			remember when this product was made and speaker CF3 even supplies the information in line (7) that she actually had one. There is no specific participant in the 
			conversation with the social rights to distribute the knowledge, but because they all remember a product due to their similar ages, they are able to provide the 
			knowledge to help with the progressivity of the conversation, this is similar to which Bolden (2011) acknowledges that progressivity and social epistemics sometimes 
			work ‘concurrently’ (Bolden 2011:239).</p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p>(1)BF2OI: //You should listen to what he's// what, some of the jobs he comes back, I, every summer and you go, "So Callum, what have you worked at this
				year?" he's like, "Well this year I was a removal man, then I worked in a library," or no, what was it you did, you were, //ehm, you've done//</p>
				<p>(2)AM1: //What have I done, I've// //I've worked//</p>
				<p>(3)BF2: //hundreds!//</p>
				<p>(4)AM1: in a pet shop then I //picked mushrooms,//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>This last example demonstrates another repair affected by relationship in accordance with social epistemics. It was realised within the conversation that speakers 
			AM1 and BF2 had actually known each other before university; therefore they had a stronger relationship with each other than with the other participants of the
			conversation. The topic in the conversation at this point concerned speaker AM1’s previous employment, however speaker BF2 was the one who was talking about his 
			employment. In line (1) speaker BF2 is using her own knowledge to give the other participants information but is then in need of help and produces an other-initiated 
			repair, selecting speaker AM1 because he has the ‘right’ (Bolden 2011:248) especially as the conversation is about him. Speaker AM1 then provides the correct information 
			in line (4).</p>
			
			<p>	The previous examples have demonstrated that social epistemics does work concurrently with progressivity as what Bolden (2011:239) had previously researched. 
			However, Bolden’s (2011) conclusion of ‘a copresent party has primary epistemic access the repair initiation selects that person – and not the speaker of the 
			trouble-source turn – to provide a repair solution’ (Bolden 2011:239) is not true when the participants have a strong relationship between them. Bolden (2011) is 
			correct in saying that ‘a copresent party has primary epistemic access’ (Bolden 2011:239) but is not correct when stating that a person selects someone other than 
			the ‘speaker of the trouble-source turn’ (Bolden 2011:239) because the examples have shown that the trouble-source turn speaker is usually the one that has the rights, 
			especially as the sisters’ are siblings with the same past experiences and knowledge. It cannot be said that age and relationship is affecting repairs involved with 
			social epistemics overall, but specifically to the data of this dissertation, they are. To gain a more firm confirmation of age and relationship affecting social 
			epistemics with repair, future studies could use a conversation where the participants are strangers and different ages and Bolden’s (2011) conclusion may be correct 
			with this data instead of the specific data of this dissertation.</p>
