			<h3 id="chapterone">Chapter One: The Preference System</h3>
			
			<p class="main-p">Liddiecoat (2007) summarised the Schegloff et al. (1977) study of the preference system and concluded that <span id="quote">‘self-repair is favoured over other-repair’</span>
			(Liddiecoat 2007:211) in all scenarios. The primary data of this dissertation have shown that there were 41 utterances of self-repair for the sisters and 42 
			for the students. There is not a significant difference in the results, nor were these repairs affected by the variables of age and relationship. Self-repair remains, 
			in all circumstances, to be favoured over other-repair. A few examples of self-repair from each conversation have been included to show that self-repair still takes on 
			the same forms identified by Schegloff et al. (1977) and are similar to each conversation therefore the variables do not affect them. Examples (2) - (5) are taken from 
			the sisters’ conversation and examples (1), (6) and (7) taken from the students.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example One</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">AF1SR:</span> Because, before that ye couldnae <u>read the s- ye know</u>, <a id="click-pop-4">//ABCs//</a></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">BF2SR:</span> But, I mean, <u>the ja- I mean</u>, it's silly, isn't it, //when ye think//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">AF1SR:</span> right up tae there for havin <u>four le-, four eh</u> spellins wrong. And ma mother went up, and gave her oh what for, ye know?</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="strong">DF4SR:</span> not Thunderbirds, <u>Thundercats!</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(5)</span><span class="strong">BF2SR:</span> I think I had <u>ehm, was it Cabbage Patch doll?</u> //I had one of them.//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(6)</span><span class="strong">BF2SR:</span> cause <u>I can ima-, I've never been to a festival or anything, but I can imagine</u> T in the Park being kinda, the same kinda //people, cause it's 
				obviously like,//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Schegloff et al., (1977) identified that self-initiations occur within the same turn and use a variety of <span id="quote">‘non-lexical speech perturbations, e.g. cut-offs, 
			sound stretches, uhs etc, to signal the possibility of repair-initiation immediately following’</span> (Schegloff et al. (1977:366). This is demonstrated in lines (3) with 
			‘four eh’ and line (5) with ‘ehm’. However, there are several instances of self-repair in these examples that do not follow this point and actually have lexical speech 
			to indicate that a repair is going to take place. Line (1) contains ‘ye know’ which is used to indicate that there is a repair going to take place - a signal. Line (2) 
			contains a repeat of the sentence ‘I mean’ along with a new word that is more suitable to avoid confusion. Line (4) is interesting because speaker DF4 repairs
			herself after saying something wrong in another turn which went unnoticed by the other speakers in the data. This shows she is not repairing to avoid confusion with the 
			other participants, but simply to repair her own knowledge. Lastly, line (6) shows speaker BF2 hedging to save her own face with 
			'I’ve never been to a festival or anything.' This hedge allows speaker BF2 to avoid causing any harm with what she is about to say. It has been found in the data of 
			this dissertation that self-repair remains to be preferred over other-repair, even when age and relationship are taken into consideration.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Liddiecoat (2007) stated that <span id="quote">‘many repairs are resolved before the possibility of other repair even arises’</span> (Liddiecoat 2007:210), this is indeed true. However, 
			unlike the similar results of self-repair from the primary data, there is a significant difference between each conversation concerning other-repairs. The sisters 
			have 22 utterances of other-repair whilst the students only have 13. The next few examples from the sisters' conversation demonstrate that the relationship variable is 
			having a substantial effect on the repairs.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Two</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> //Ye'd tae go tae Ayr Academy// [inaudible] //cookery.//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">AF1OR:</span> <u>//No.// No, you went, //we had, we//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">BF2SR:</span> <u>//I did!//</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">The topic of conversation at the point of this other-repair was the sisters discussing classes they had in school. Line (2) shows speaker AF1 attempting to 
			correct the trouble she has located in line (1). However, the trouble-source speaker BF2 does not agree with the other-correction and exclaims ‘I did!’ in line (3) 
			- she is self-repairing because this is the preference. Line (2) is obviously a dispreferred. The relationship variable appears to be effecting this repair 
			because the speakers have a large amount of knowledge of each other’s lives as sisters. They feel they can correct each other when a problem has not been dealt with 
			by the trouble source speaker (Liddiecoat 2007:175).</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Three</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">AF1:</span> //And eh,// //ye got mental//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">CF3OR:</span> <u>//Mental block.//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">AF1SR:</span> arithmetic,<u> ye g- and yer spellin</u> and everythin. And yer grammar, I think, was taught a lot better then.</p>
			</div>

			<p class="main-p">This is another example of other-repair being refused in the conversation between the sisters. It should be noted that none of these types of other-repair appeared 
			in the students’ data; therefore the relationship of the sisters is effecting these repairs. Speaker CF3 notices a repairable in line (1) and gives an other-repair in line 
			(2). However, speaker AF1 does not take this correction and self-repairs herself in line (3). The other-repair in this example is dispreferred and speaker AF1 avoids 
			being corrected which stays with the preference.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Four</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">AF1SR:</span> eh in the wages office and learnt the <u>comput- eh, //comptometer.//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">DM4OR:</span> <u>//Comptometer.//</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">There were two examples of other-repair in the sisters’ data that illustrated other-repair as being helpful in order to continue the progress of conversation. 
			This example shows speaker DM4 correcting what speaker AF1 is attempting to say in line (1). However, it should be noted that this example also illustrates self-repair being 
			preferred, as in line (1) we see the self-initiated non-lexical perturbation of ‘eh’ indicating that she is about to self-repair, and at the same time, speaker DM4 gives the 
			other-repair in line (2), therefore the other-repair is dispreferred.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Five</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> //Ye// played marbles,</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">AF1OR:</span><u> Bools.</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">A final example of other-repair taken from the sisters’ conversation demonstrates an other-repair that was not then used as a self-repair in the following turn; it 
			is just a complete correction. Speaker AF1 does not agree with what speaker BF2 says in line (1) and repairs her in line (2). It appears that the relationship variable 
			is effecting this repair because as what has been described before, the sisters have knowledge of past experiences that the students do not have with each other, 
			thus the sisters are able to use other-repair where they believe there is a trouble in their past knowledge.</p>

			<p class="main-p">The examples of other-repair taken from the sisters’ conversation has demonstrated an almost blunt, impolite way of correcting each other. In contrast, the students, 
			when other-repairing, use hedging to soften the blow of their other-repair.  This is mainly to avoid a face-threatening act, simply because their relationship is not as strong 
			as the sisters’, they cannot repair each other without using politeness.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Six</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">AM1SR:</span> No, <u>we had, ehm, we had registration at</u>, like, ten to, then we had //ten, ten//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">BF2OR:</span> <u>//Ten to nine?//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">AM1:</span> to nine.</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Line (1) shows speaker AM1 struggling to think of a word to use to confirm when he had registration. Line (2) looks like other-initiated repair, however, casting aside 
			the punctuation at the end of the utterance, speaker BF2 is offering a solution to speaker AM1’s self-initiation, even though the self-initiation is following what 
			Schegloff et al. (1977) illustrated with the use of ‘ehm’ in his utterance. However, this other-repair is not impolite nor is it seen as being negative because it is 
			helpful, and speaker AM1 corrects himself in line (3), which is his preferred. It could be noted that age is effecting this repair because as they are all students of 
			the same age and have experienced secondary school at the same time, they have the knowledge of knowing when classes would of started. This knowledge is allowing them to 
			correct each other when a problem should arise.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Seven</em></p>
			 
			 <div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">CF3:</span> //But you now know where the field// is, we could all go.</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">AM1OR:</span> <u>It's not a field</u>, it's like, they're in big, //you know like sort of dome sort of things? They're in there.//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">The final example of other-repair taken from the students’ conversation illustrates another use of hedging in the other-repair of line (2). Speaker AM1 notices the 
			problem of ‘the field’ in line (1) and in order to keep the conversation faithful to the truth, he offers other-repair. However, instead of being blunt with the 
			correction as what was noted in the sister’s examples, he attempts to justify and give information as to why what is being spoken about is not really a field, 
			therefore he is trying to soften the blow of the other-repair and attempting to avoid any form of negativity that could be placed on speaker CF3.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">The conclusion set by Schegloff et al. (1977) that <span id="quote">‘self-correction is preferred to other-correction’</span> (Schegloff et al 1977:362) remains true with the primary data, 
			as each conversation contained large, equal results of self-repair compared to other-repair. Self-repair is not effected by age or relationship; it is simply in our 
			human nature for us to correct ourselves over someone else correcting us. On the other hand, other-repair appears to be effected by both relationship and age. The 
			sisters’ other-repairs were all effected by their relationship, which allowed them to correct each other because of their shared knowledge of past experiences and could 
			repair without having to take politeness into consideration. In contrast, the students’ had a significantly lower result of other-repair and none of them were effected 
			by relationship. One example could be assumed to be effected by age, but it is not truly confirmed. However, the students appeared to use more politeness in their 
			other-repairs through hedging to avoid any negative face-acts on each other, showing that their relationship is not as strong as the sisters.</p>
