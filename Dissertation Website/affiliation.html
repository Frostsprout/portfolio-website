			<h3 id="affiliation">Chapter Two: The Unique 'Other'-Selection of Other-Initiated Repair</h3>
			
			<p class="mini-headers">2.2 Affiliation</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Egbert (1997) contributed to the research into the unique other-initiated repair found in multiperson conversation by analysing and producing data that illustrated
			when repair is initiated by more than one speaker, they are doing so to display affiliation (Egbert 1997:619). From the data, there are two examples of affiliation from 
			the sisters’ 22 other-initiations and one example from the students’ 19 other-initiations. It is also noted that a few of these examples have been analysed in accordance 
			with social epistemics, but they also reflect the examples used by Egbert (1997) from their study.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Egbert (1997) specifies that for affiliation to be noticeable, all the speakers of the conversation must give a repair-initiation (Egbert 1997:619) in the same-turn. 
			This then allows the speakers to connect with each other; it was proposed that the sisters' would affiliate more with each other rather than the students because of 
			their strong relationship. The data found only shows a difference of one between the conversations, therefore there is simply not enough evidence to support this 
			claim. However, examples of affiliation were found and the reasons for the affiliation were because of age and relationship. The sisters’ examples will be analysed 
			first.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Thirteen</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">BF2SR:</span> //Ye had a class in// <u>loi- laundry</u> and ye had //to take//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">AF1:</span> //mmhm//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> articles fae the house and //ye washed them.// </p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="strong">AF1OR:</span> <u>//A hanky!//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(5)</span><span class="strong">CF3OR:</span> //[inaudible] <u>hanky was the first//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(6)</span><span class="strong">BF2SR:</span> <u>//A lady's and a gent's hanky.//</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Line (1) is the trouble source of example thirteen, speaker BF2 has said something that is not fully acceptable to her two sisters. The main affiliation appears between 
			lines (4) to (6), this is also an overlap therefore both speakers AF1 and CF3 in lines (4) and (5) immediately produce a repair-initiation and line (6) shows speaker 
			BF2 accepting and confirming what lines (4) and (5) have produced. Egbert (1997) stated that the second (line (4)) and third (line (5)) repair initiation’s <span id="quote">‘primary 
			function is to display alignment rather than trouble in hearing or understanding’</span> (Egbert 1997:619) and this is what is displayed through this example. The relationship 
			variable has an effect on this repair-initiation because the other sisters have the knowledge of what speaker BF2 is speaking of therefore are able to join into the 
			conversation to show that they remember what is being discussed and they are all connected by this.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Fourteen</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">AF1SR:</span> And then I left there and, when I was sixteen, and I went tae work in Gray's office <u>in the s- in the wages office.</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">BF2OI:</span> <u>//No, the stamp work!//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="storng">CF3OI:</span> <u>The stamp-work?</u> </p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(5)</span><span class="storng">AF1SR:</span> <u>The stamp-work, sorry,</u> //I went to work in the//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Example fourteen is similar to the previous, the affiliation begins with the second repair initiation in line (2) and the third repair initiation in line (4) where the two 
			sisters join in by correcting what speaker AF1 has said. This can also be seen as social epistemics as the sisters' relationship of sharing past 
			experiences together allows them to correct when things are said incorrectly. However, Egbert (1997) stated that affiliation was when the other speakers of the 
			conversation would produce other-repairs at the same time because of the same trouble-source (Egbert 1997:614) and this is reflected through this example.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Relationship effects the affiliation between the sisters in each of these examples. In contrast, it is the age variable that effects the affiliation 
			between the students from the one example discovered.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Fifteen</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">AM1OI:</span> //Remember, <u>what did you call it,</u> that//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">CF3:</span> //With some lots, with some nice E numbers in it, get you hi-//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">AM1OI:</span> <u>other drink thing?</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="strong">DF4OR:</span> Stream, Stream <u>//Sodastream.//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(5)</span><span class="strong">AM1OR:</span> <u>//Sodastream.</u> It was just like//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(6)</span><span class="strong">BF2OR:</span> <u>//Sodastream.//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(7)</span><span class="strong">CF3OR:</span> <u>//Sodastream,</u> I had one of them// //in my house. I loved it!//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Similar to the sisters’ affiliation examples, example fifteen also appeared under the social epistemics section as example eleven, and this is because this example also displays 
			affiliation among the speakers because all of the participants use other-repair at the same time. The affiliation begins from lines (4) to (7) where all the 
			participants agree on the answer of ‘Sodastream’. The affiliation is easily noticeable because all the participants are able to agree on something and none of 
			them are pushed aside from the conversation, they are all connected. This example also shows that affiliation is not restricted 
			to only a second and third repair initiation, but to any number of participants as it is unique to multiperson conversation. This affiliation is affected by the age variable,
			all of the students are the same age, therefore this is the reason why they all remember this product because it is something from their childhood that they 
			have all shared and are able to connect through this.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">The linguistic variables of age and relationship are effecting these examples of affiliation by other-initiation repairs, but there is simply not enough evidence from 
			each conversation to confirm whether or not the sisters are affiliating more than the students because of their stronger sibling relationship.</p>
