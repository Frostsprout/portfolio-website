			<h3 id="researchtitle">Research Context</h3>
			
			<p id="research">The research has been split into three sections that correlate and provide context to the three chapters of this dissertation.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="mini-headers">The Preference System</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">The preference system was created and identified by Schegloff et al. (1977) and they came to the conclusion that <span id="quote">‘self-correction and other-correction are related organisationally, 
			with self-correction preferred to other-correction’</span> (Schegloff et al. 1977:362).  Therefore, members of a conversation would rather correct their own repair in their own turn 
			without having another member in the conversation correct their problem. Schegloff et al. (1977) also identified how members of a conversation will make an indication that they are going to repair immediately 
			so that no other participant will offer a repair solution. They <span id="quote">‘use of a variety of non-lexical speech perturbations, e.g. cut-offs, sound stretches, uhs etc’</span> (Schegloff et al. 1977:366) which gives knowledge of 
			how to identify when the person is going to make a repair. </p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Liddicoat’s (2007) general discussion of conversation analysis helped with understanding Schegloff et al.’s (1977) study as it is over thirty years old and gave a 
			contemporary understanding of the repair device. Liddiecoat (2007) stated that Schegloff et al. (1977) <span id="quote">‘argue that this preference is not simply a matter of an 
			overwhelming number of instances of self-repair, but also that the system is designed to achieve self-repair’</span> (Liddiecoat 2007:210) and that the participants, 
			in by following the preference system, will create <span id="quote">‘a self-regulating system’ </span>(Liddiecoat 2007:211) which will help when problems arise. This point gives knowledge that 
			the preference system is not only used for participants to achieve self-repair, but it is a system that all participants of a conversation should follow for a successful 
			conversation. Also, by understanding the preference system, they will achieve self-repair automatically or as <span id="quote">‘self-regulating’</span> (Liddiecoat 2007:211). </p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Schegloff et al’s. (1977) discovery of the preference system and Liddiecoat’s (2007) contribution to its understanding are of great interest to this dissertation 
			because they provide the information on how to identify instances of self-repair in the data, especially if they are not as clear as one would assume.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="mini-headers">The Unique 'Other'-Selection of Other-Initiated Repair</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">There are a number of studies that analyse the specific multiperson conversation repair of the ‘other’-selection in other-initiated repair. The studies all take a 
			different approach to this specific repair. Bolden (2011) analyses the social epistemics involved with multiperson conversation (Bolden 2011:241). Drew (1997) focuses 
			on politeness words that do not locate the problem in need of repair, but instead create an indication that there has been difficulty in understanding. Egbert (1997) 
			studied how in multiperson conversation, if more than one speaker initiates repair, they are doing so to display affiliation among the speakers (1997). And lastly, 
			Svennevig (2008) researched on the use of other-initiated repair and claims that other-initiation is used for problems of understanding, acceptability and hearing.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Bolden (2011) analysed social epistemics which are of great interest to this dissertation. Bolden (2011) stated that an <span id="quote">‘interlocutor’s rights and responsibilities to 
			socially distributed knowledge may be involved in next turn speaker selection’</span> (Bolden 2011:248) and ‘knowledge of one’s experience is firmly bound to the individual who has 
			lived through them’ (Bolden 2011:253). Therefore, if a member of the conversation has knowledge of what is being discussed, then they have the right to other-initiate repair, 
			even though it is going against the preference system, when self-repair is preferred, they have this knowledge through life experiences and therefore have the right to repair. 
			The primary data of this dissertation are three sisters who are specifically given the question of reminiscing to discuss/contribute to the conversation. They should have 
			knowledge of each other’s lives when they were younger which is where social epistemics will be acknowledged, therefore the relationship variable should play a role in the 
			distribution of social epistemics. The second conversation with students has been given the specific topic of discussing music and festivals therefore they will also be able to 
			draw on shared knowledge or their own knowledge and will <span id="quote">‘retain a privileged access to what is being said’ </span>(Bolden 2011:253).</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Drew’s (1997) study focused on open-class repair initiators – words such as <span id="quote">‘pardon’, ‘sorry?’ ‘what?’</span>(Drew 1997:71). These words ‘leave open what is the repairable trouble 
			which the speaker is having with the prior turn’ (Drew 1997:72). Drew (1997) puts these politeness words down to being the speaker having trouble with hearing or understanding
			which would create problems and the need for the repair device, but by using politeness words, they are not <span id="quote">‘locating specifically where or what that difficulty is’</span> (Drew 1997:71). 
			This study appears to say that by using politeness, the participant is not going against the preference system, but are initiating repair politely therefore saving the fact of the 
			trouble-source speaker. This study is of interest to the dissertation because of its research into ‘other’-selection other-initiated repair which is specific to multiperson 
			conversations. Drew (1997) gives the initiative that when politeness words are used as an open-class repair initiator, they are doing so because they have had trouble with what has
			been said, but are not specifically saying what the trouble is, which ‘opens’ the ground for the other members to supply an other-repair to resolve the problem – this can connect to Bolden’s 
			(2011) idea of progressivity because other members can repair and move along with the conversation. This study is of relevance to the dissertation because, through relationship, 
			sisters may not feel the need to be polite with each other, whilst students may want to be polite – the age variable will also demonstrate if younger people use politeness words 
			more than older people.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Egbert (1997) studied the ‘other’-selection repair, however, her study came to the conclusion that when more than one member of the conversation tries to repair they 
			are doing so <span id="quote">‘to display affiliation’</span> (Egbert 1997:613).  Because there are more than two members in the group, affiliation seems to be something that is desirable to the
			speakers so that they can connect more strongly with the other members and engage more thoroughly in the conversation. Egbert (1997) continues by stating that observing 
			the repairs for affiliation, the members of the conversation, whether it is the second or third person making the repair, they are doing so <span id="quote">‘to display alignment rather
			than trouble in hearing or understanding’</span> (Egbert 1997:619). Therefore, instead of offering a repair to resolve trouble, they are giving a repair to show that they are 
			in agreement with what the primary speaker’s repair initiation was so that they connect with the speaker. This is of relevance to this dissertation because by using 
			repair to show affiliation may or may not be apparent when the linguistic variable of relationship is taken into consideration – sisters may not feel the need to 
			affiliate because they are siblings and already have a connection, whilst the students may feel a greater need to affiliate with each other to stay in connection with 
			their conversation.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Svennevig (2008) is in an agreement with Drew (1997) with other-initiation being used to display a problem in speaking, hearing and understanding (Svennevig 2008:336) 
			but not through politeness words that do not pick a specific point of trouble. Svennevig (2008) notes that <span id="quote">‘indicating a problem of hearing may be done explicitly 
			(‘what did you say?’) or implicitly (‘huh?’ ‘pardon’? etc)’</span> (Svennevig 2008:336) and that problems can also be <span id="quote">‘unspecific or specific, as in partial repeats plus a 
			question word, e.g. Ross, what?’</span> (Svennevig 2008:336).  The partial repeat is selecting an actual speaker, which could possibly be seen as a face-threatening act, 
			particularly within multiperson conversation. However, Svennevig (2008) makes the observation that speakers who say ‘what do you mean?’ as an other-initiation are not 
			contributing to solving the problem, but are instead <span id="quote">‘saving one’s own face rather than saving that of the interlocutor’</span> (Svennevig 2008:345). This study is of importance 
			to the dissertation because it can be observed to see through the linguistic variable of relationship – particularly if being sibling’s means that you can constitute a 
			face-threatening act by producing an other-initiation repair.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="mini-headers">The Banter Principle</p>
			<p class="main-p">The banter principle was identified and created by Geoffrey Leech (1983). Leech (1983) stated that in order to follow this principle, the participant would have to 
			produce an utterance that is: (i) obviously untrue and (ii) obviously impolite to the hearer (Leech 1983:144). To illustrate this principle, Leech (1983) used the 
			examples of a participant saying to another ‘here comes trouble’ or ‘look what the cat’s brought in’ (Leech 1983:144). These examples show that what is said can be 
			seen as being impolite and could possibly threaten the face of the other, but due to the underlying layer of banter, what is said is actually seen as being friendly. 
			Leech (1983) concluded that banter is <span id="quote">‘offensive on the surface but at a deeper level is intended to maintain comity’</span> (Leech 1983:100) and Nowik-Dziewicka (2004) 
			agreed with this statement of layers, commenting, <span id="quote">‘in banter utterances, we have two layers of meaning: the surface layer of impoliteness and the proper layer of 
			politeness’</span> (2004:163).</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Nowik-Dziewicka claimed that banter is <span id="quote">‘very popular among young people’</span> (2004:163) but had no statistics to show whether or not this was true via a study. Therefore, 
			this statement is something that can be used to argue against within the dissertation through the age variable. Leech (1983; 2014) did not make any reference to whether 
			or not banter was restricted to a certain age. The statement can possibly be true because if we take contemporary society into consideration alongside a sociolinguistic 
			view, each generation of speakers appear to have new ways of communicating with each other. The younger generations may take pride in mocking each other in conversation 
			whilst older generations may see it as rude. For example, saying ‘look at the state of this guy here!’ or ‘here comes grumpy’ can be seen as being impolite, but these 
			kinds of statements are what is produced by members of a conversation who are friendly with each other. We can see the surface layers that both Leech (1983; 2014) and 
			Nowik-Dziewicka (2004) identified through these examples and they give an idea of what to look for when analysing a conversation for banter. However, saying that banter 
			is <span id="quote">‘very popular among young people’</span> (Nowik-Dziewicka 2004:163) produces the argument that banter may not be popular amongst older people. The statement is what produced 
			the argument for the research question of this dissertation concerning the banter principle to see if older participants of a conversation will produce more banter 
			utterances than younger participants, especially if they are siblings.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">The banter principle is a very interesting piece of research that has been produced because it plays a role within conversations that allows the participants to show 
			off their friendship by being offensive and impolite (Leech 1983; 2014 and Nowik-Dziewicka 2004) which is applied to the dissertation.</p>
