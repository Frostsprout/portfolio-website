			<!-- HIDDEN POPUP SCOTSCORPUS -->
			<div id="popup-1">
			<div id="popup-title">ScotsCorpus</div>
			<p>Is a collaborative project between the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh.</p>
			<p>It currently contains over 1300 written and spoken texts, totally over 4.5 million words of running text. 77% of the total is made up 
			of written texts and 23% is made up of spoken texts.</p>
			<p>The corpus allows linguists to analyse any changes that have occurred in Scots language through a large number of years and contains a wide
			variety of speakers from different locations with different backgrounds.</p>
			</div>
			
			<!-- HIDDEN POPUP OBSERVER PARADOX -->
			<div id="popup-2">
			<div id="popup-title">The Observer's Paradox</div>
			<p>This term was created by William Labov, who states 'the aim of linguistic research in the community must be to find out how people talk when they are not being 
			systematically observed; yet we can only obtain this data by systematic observation.'</p>
			<p>People are aware when they are being recorded and will sometimes not act as truthfully as they would had there not been a recorder in front of them. However,
			after a period of time, people become more comfortable and forget the recorder is there.</p>
			</div>
			
			<!-- HIDDEN POPUP ANTCONC -->
			<div id="popup-3">
			<div id="popup-title">AntConc</div>
			<p>Created by Laurence Anthony, AntConc is a freeware corpus analysis toolkit for concordancing and text analysis.</p>
			<p>It is presented as a simple UI and has helped count each instance and type of repair in this dissertation without mistake.</p>
			</div>
		
			<h3 id="method">Methodology</h3>

			<p class="main-p">The data for this dissertation are two conversations taken from <a id="click-pop"><em>ScotsCorpus.</em></a>
			The dissertation itself is a general analysis that was not influenced by any of the research involved with this 
			dissertation. However, in each study identified in the research context, there are examples of conversations and the repair is highlighted, and this is what has been replicated. 
			There is also an underline indicating where the repair takes place in each example.
			Each conversation was analysed separately and the first 1,000 words of each transcript was omitted to avoid <a id="click-pop-2">the observer’s paradox</a> because they are transcripts of 
			recorded conversations. The transcripts were analysed whilst listening to the recording of each conversation – one was audio and one was a video – to make sure that 
			utterances were repairs and were not just overlaps and pauses as this is a common mistake. The coding of each speaker in the conversations were changed to make it easier to reference and read, 
			e.g. ‘F640’ would become AF1 – ‘A’ for alphabetical order, 'F' for female and '1' for first speaker, BF2 for second female speaker, and so on. The shortened codes made it easier for analysis through 
			the concordance software. The repairs were also coded in a certain way for easier analysis. Other-repair = OR (it was assumed that this type of repair would need 
			a thorough analysis to see which type of other-repair is taking place because the research context specified there are many studies concerning different types). 
			SR = self-repair, OI = other-initiated. Banter, politeness, and epistemics were labeled and put in brackets after each example identified.  The concordance programme 
			<a id="click-pop-3"><em>AntConc</em></a> was lastly used. Each fully annotated conversation was uploaded separately and <em>AntConc</em> was used to count the frequencies for
			self-repair, other-initiated-repair, other-repair, banter and epistemics in each conversation.</p>
			
			<p class="mini-headers">Three Sisters' Conversation</p>
			<p class="main-p">The three sisters of the conversation are aged in their late 60s to 70s; therefore the linguistic variables of age and relationship are both included in the conversation,
			which is a requirement for the research.
			The conversation had 8,913 words but only 7,918 words were analysed to avoid the observer’s paradox. There are three female speakers and one male speaker, they were coded 
			as AF1, BF2, CF3 and DM4 – the female speakers are family members, the male is not, he is the one who is recording and asking the questions, but he will be a participant to be equal
			with the members of the students' conversation. 
			There was a problem with the recording and transcript of this conversation as it was analysed.
			The recording had to be paused to mark in the document where the repair was, however when listening to the recording the transcript would highlight what part of the conversation 
			it was following. At first this was extremely helpful, but it would sometimes not load correctly and time was wasted having to wait for the audio file to buffer and also to 
			re-locate the part of the recording that was being analysed.</p>

			<p class="mini-headers">Four Students' conversation</p>
			<p class="main-p">The four students were all roughly 21 years old and they considered themselves friends, which was necessary for comparison with the sisters' conversation
			- if a sibling relationship was stronger than friendship between non-relative friends.
			The codes for this conversation are changed to AM1 for the male speaker, and BF2, CF3 and DF4 for the three female speakers. The conversation was 11,091 words 
			and was shortened to 10,091 words to avoid the observer’s paradox. A problem occurred in the analysis of this conversation also because it was a video file instead 
			of an audio file like the sisters' conversation. It had difficulty syncing with the transcript as it was being highlighted to show where it was in the transcripts. The 
			participants would talk very fast and there was no possible way to slow the highlighting, therefore it was quite difficult to mark where the repairs in the conversation 
			were occurring. Also, the video file cut out completely a quarter of the way into the analysis, the video was refreshed, but it was still cutting out, therefore, part of the 
			conversation was omitted because it was not possible to show whether or not an utterance was a repair or was an overlap or pause. Future works wishing to do an analysis 
			of corpora should produce their own recordings to analyse, instead of relying on a recording synched from the internet. Having a recording of your own would allow 
			stopping and pausing as many times as you would like without the possibility of the website not synching correctly.</p>
