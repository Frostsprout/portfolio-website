		<br>
		
		<div id="home-info">
		<p class="home-page">Pragmatics and Spoken Discourse was my favourite course at Glasgow University. It focuses on how language is affected by human interaction in all its 
		different forms. There were many topics in the course, including childrenâ€™s conversations, classroom discussions, politeness and the ways meaning is created through 
		interaction.</p>
		
		<p class="home-page">To complete my degree, I was to write a dissertation on a subject of my choice.  Pragmatics and Spoken Discourse was my choice.  Through careful planning,
		I decided to choose Conversational Repairs as my focal point.  Repairs constantly appear in conversation, we may not even realise when a repair has taken place, whether we 
		repair ourselves or we choose to repair other participants of our conversation.</p>
		
		<p class="home-page">Focusing primarily on Conversational Repairs is difficult, there has been a large amount of research already conducted and it is a vague subject, with 
		more or less everything covered.  To create an entirely original piece of research, I decided to apply linguistic variables I learned from another course, Sociolinguistics, 
		to the research.  The variables allowed me to focus on repairs with extra information to make the data and results more specific.  I was therefore looking for repairs in 
		conversation with age and relationship variables. I was also advised to include a section dedicated to Leech's Banter Principle, as this is a small area of research that has 
		not had a large amount of contribution. The dissertation is therefore pragmatic theory with sociolinguistic elements combined.</p>
		
		<p class="home-page">This dissertation took under seven months to complete and was submitted in March 2015 to the University of Glasgow.</p>
