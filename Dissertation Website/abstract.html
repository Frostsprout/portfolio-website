			<p class="main-p">Based on an analysis of recorded multiperson conversation, this dissertation examines the affect the linguistic variables of age and relationship 
			have on the repairs used in two conversations - one among four young students and the other between three mature sisters. In particular, this dissertation 
			focuses on three aspects of repair taken from previous research. These aspects are:</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="questions"><span id="number">1)</span>The preference system of self-repair and other-repair which states that self-repair is preferred 
			and other-repair is dispreferred. It is found in the results that self-repair is not affected by linguistic variables, but other-repair can be affected, 
			particularly by a strong, sibling relationship.</p> 
			<p class="questions"><span id="number">2)</span>The unique ‘other-selection’ in other-initiated repair which comes from a variety of studies is used 
			to clarify hearing, acceptability and understanding, used for affiliation, and used to have politeness words avoid face-threatening acts. The linguistic 
			variables do affect each of these factors involved with this repair, however, it cannot be fully confirmed whether or not they do because of limited results.</p> 
			<p class="questions"><span id="number">3)</span>The banter principle is used as mock politeness to show emotional closeness and intimacy between the speakers. 
			The linguistic variables affect banter, but similarly to previous, there is not enough data to confirm whether or not this is true or just context-specific to 
			the data of this dissertation.</p>
