			<h3 id="chapterthree">Chapter Three: The Interpersonal Banter Principle</h3>
			
			<p class="main-p">Leech (1983) describes the banter principle as <span id="quote">‘a form of underpoliteness or mock-impoliteness. It is an offensive way of being friendly…’ </span>(Leech 1983:163). When 
			participants of a conversation are using banter it is <span id="quote">‘supposed to mark emotional closeness or even intimacy’</span> (Leech 1983:163). There was not a large number of banter 
			examples within the data, and this was rather surprising as it was assumed that there would be a several utterances between sisters because of their 
			relationship, however this was not true. The results show that there is only one utterance of banter from the sisters’ conversation.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Twenty-One</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> oh phhh, but <u>you're ancient!</u> //eh I//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Leech (1983) stated that when participants use banter, they have to <span id="quote">‘say something which is (i) obviously untrue (ii) obviously impolite to (the) hearer'</span> (Leech (1983:163). 
			Example twenty-one demonstrates that speaker BF2 is calling her sister ancient, referring to her age.  This is both untrue and impolite (Leech 1983:163).
			In the recording, after this utterance was said, it was followed by laughter from the other sister; it was impolite to her, but she was not offended 
			and what was said is clearly unserious (Leech 1983:145). Leech (1983) explained that when people use banter with each other they are doing so to <span id="quote">‘prove what 
			good buddies we are’</span> (Leech 1983:101), and although this is the only example of banter from the sisters’, their sibling relationship allows speaker BF2 to say line 
			(1) without being impolite.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Even though only one example of Leech's banter was found in the sisters’ conversation, there did appear to be some form of underlying impoliteness between the sisters as they spoke.  This is
			because they are sisters – the relationship variable is effecting the need for politeness. Leech (1983) explained that a <span id="quote">‘lack of politeness in itself can become a sign of 
			intimacy’</span> (Leech 1983:146), and in the conversation there appears to be an overall feeling of this, the sisters were naturally more impolite to each other. 
			An example, not of banter, but of this general impoliteness, lies in example twenty-two.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Twenty-Two</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">BF2OI:</span> //I think// <u>you're makin //a mistake there, Margaret,//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">AF1SR:</span> //for nine o'clock.// <u>//I'm not!//</u></p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">BF2OI:</span> //bread was never// rationed. //Bread.//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="strong">AF1OR:</span> <u>//Bread was// rationed, Mary.</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Line (1) is rather impolite because speaker BF2 is placing a face-threatening act on speaker AF1 by stating her name, the impoliteness 
			is obviously being directed to her. Speaker AF1 does not accept a repair, and then produces an other-repair in line (4), directing the repair to her sister by 
			saying her name this time. This overall looks impolite, and the students did not have any examples of this (speaker-selection) in their data. So, even though this example is not banter, 
			and the sisters only had one utterance of banter, this type of impoliteness throughout the conversation is a <span id="quote">‘sign of intimacy’</span> (Leech 1983:146) because of their 
			relationship as sisters. This result contributes to the research as the relationship variable affects impoliteness which brings about more repairs.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">The students’ conversation contained five examples of banter, which is considerably higher than the sisters’. Leech (1983) stated that banter <span id="quote">‘is very popular among 
			young people’</span> (Leech 1983:163) and this statement is reflected by the results of this dissertation.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Twenty-Three</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">BF2SR:</span> //I did have one.// //I will admit I did, but it k-, it died, like, every day.//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">DF4:</span> //[laugh]// <u>//You obviously were not a very good mother</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">In example twenty-three, the students were talking about toys from their childhood. Line (1) has speaker BF2 give information on a toy and speaker DF4 
			replies in line (2) with the banter (Leech 1983:145). The conversation carries on with speaker BF2 laughing at what was said; she was
			not offended by the impoliteness of utterance (2). If this utterance was not considered as banter, speaker BF2 would be offended, but because of the surface layer
			of impoliteness, (line (2)) there is the true layer (Leech 1983:163) of politeness which shows a <span id="quote">‘closeness’</span> (Leech 1983:163) between the two speakers.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Twenty-Four</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">CF3:</span> I'd camped out and it was, I'd just started getting boyfriends, you know how it's all nice and   it's all new and exciting? //An I remember, until you go, 
				until you go//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">DF4:</span> <u>//Then you smell them the third day and you're totally mingin!</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Example twenty-four demonstrates a sort of closeness (Leech 1983:163) between the two speakers. Line (1) in full context is speaker CF3 discussing her time at a music 
			festival and is speaking of her boyfriend. However, in line (2), speaker DF4 is offensive to speaker CF3. This is impolite 
			and offensive to speaker CF3, but because it is banter, and the speakers are friends, speaker DF4 is able to say 
			this. They see it as, <span id="quote">‘I can insult you, and you will respond to it as a joke’</span> (Leech 1983:101).</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Twenty-Five</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">AM1:</span> //good old skulls round our necks and plectrums and stuff and thought we were, like,//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> //[laugh]//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">CF3:</span> //Get some [inaudible] plecs or whatever they're called for your//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="strong">DF4:</span> //[laugh]//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(5)</span><span class="strong">AM1:</span> //thought we were the bees knees. Yeah, totally. [laugh]//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(6)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> <u>//Did you wear a skull round your neck? Oh no!//</u></p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">The banter in example twenty-five occurs at line (6) where the speaker BF2 mocks speaker AM1. It is impolite, but as the 
			example shows, all the speakers are engaging with what is said in line (1) and are all laughing and joking, and speaker AM1 in line (5) is mocking himself, therefore 
			the impoliteness of line (6) is banter. Due to all the speakers being involved in this example, the banter is showing <span id="quote">‘in-group solidarity’</span> (Leech 1983:101), where all 
			the speakers are joining together to laugh and mock what is being said – their relationship of friends is affecting their use of politeness.</p>
			
			<p class="research-headers"><em>Example Twenty-Six</em></p>
			
			<div class="example">
				<p><span id="small-number">(1)</span><span class="strong">CF3:</span> //At twenty-one you// can drink in the US and you can drive a lorry.</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(2)</span><span class="strong">DF4:</span> <u>Oh good //cause I'm so desperate to do both of them</u> [clapping]//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(3)</span><span class="strong">AM1:</span> //[laugh]//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(4)</span><span class="strong">BF2:</span> //[laugh]//</p>
				<p><span id="small-number">(5)</span><span class="storng">CF3:</span> //[laugh]//</p>
			</div>
			
			<p class="main-p">Finally, example twenty-six has speaker DF4, in line (2), mocking what speaker CF3 has said in line (1). Lines (3) to (5) have been included in order to show 
			that the banter spoken in line (2) was seen as humorous and not offensive; especially as speaker CF3 also laughs therefore she was not offended.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Banter is very scarce amongst the sisters, and with the students there are a very small number of banter examples. However, the examples analysed here have 
			demonstrated what Leech (1983) argued of <span id="quote">‘banter is offensive on the surface but at a deeper level is intended to maintain comity’</span> (Leech 1983:100) is true in this 
			dissertation’s data.  All the participants would laugh and respond to the banter utterances without negativity, no damage is done. The sisters’ 
			banter utterances were rather difficult to discover because they were not similar to what Leech (1983) originally illustrated (e.g. ‘look what the cat’s brought in!’ 
			and ‘here comes trouble!’ (Leech 1983:144)). However, Leech's research is rather out-dated, contemporary banter is sure to be different, but there was no research available to 
			confirm this. The sisters are relatively impolite to each other throughout their entire conversation as their other-repair count is 22 whilst the students other-
			repair count is 13 – as other-repair is seen as dispreferred, they are most likely impolite. It was noted the sisters’ lack of politeness was a <span id="quote">‘sign of intimacy’</span> 
			(Leech 1983:146) and they could be impolite to each other because of their sibling relationship. The students were not impolite to each other and their five results of 
			banter were the only examples of impoliteness. It appears their relationship of friends is not intimate enough for them to be constantly  
			impolite to each other.  However, their banter utterances follow what Leech (1983) confirmed as <span id="quote">‘in order to show solidarity with (the) hearer, say something which is (i) 
			obviously untrue (ii) obviously impolite to the hearer' </span> (Leech 1983:144), and the students' banter results clearly demonstrates this. Banter does not 
			appear to be entirely restricted to younger people, as Leech (1983) had previously said. However, this cannot be confirmed because the 
			relationship variable laced through the sisters’ conversation has skewed the results. The relationship variable, although a disadvantage to age, has the 
			advantage of showing that a close relationship does affect banter.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Leech (1983) stated, <span id="quote">‘banter is not normally used between people who are of unequal power status, or who are strangers’</span> (Leech 1983:271). This could not be 
			applied to the data of this dissertation because all of the participants knew each other. Future works could analyse specific data of strangers having a conversation and 
			this may give more promising results to see if age and relationship affects the use of banter in conversation. Leech (1983) said <span id="quote">‘banter is by no means 
			restricted to the male gender’</span> (Leech 1983:274), from the data of this dissertation, this does appear to be true as it is females who are producing banter 
			utterances.  However, there is only one male participant in each conversation with three female participants, this point could not be analysed fully – a 
			selection of varied participants would have been better for a more assuring result.</p>
