			<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
			
			<p class="main-p">It cannot be confirmed if repairs are affected by age and relationship from the results of this dissertation. The primary data proved to be limited, there was
			simply not enough data to make significant comparisons between each conversation to show whether or not a young age or an old age was affecting the repairs, or if a
			sibling relationship was effecting repairs more than a friendship. At times the results would show slight figure differences between each conversation, therefore, not
			enough to fully confirm a difference or even to confirm if these variables were affecting the repair or if it was just coincidence.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Although there was not enough data for a true confirmation, the data did provide certain results that have shown how these variables affect the repairs. It was 
			assumed that the linguistic variables would affect the preference system in the sisters' conversation, and other-repair would be affected by their relationship and there 
			would be a higher number of other-repair utterances. This was confirmed as true. However, it was thought the students would have more self-repairs because their 
			relationship was not as strong as the sisters and would be more self-conscious of what they said. The results illustrated that self-repair was equal between each 
			conversation.  The assumption was false.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">Through the unique ‘other’-selection of other-initiated repair, it was proposed that the linguistic variable would affect this repair through social epistemics and 
			the sisters would have knowledge of each other’s past experience and would be able to repair when it was required. In the results, there were not 
			many instances of repairs following social epistemics between each conversation, but relationship was affecting the repairs of social epistemics with the sisters. It was
			also found that the age variable affected the students' repairs, but only through one example, which is not significant enough to confirm if it truly is affecting the 
			repair, or is a coincidence. There were two instances of affiliation affected by the relationship variable in the sisters’ conversation, and one instance of age 
			affecting affiliation from the students’ conversation. The repair-initiators section found that only a few of the examples given were affected by the 
			linguistic variables. However, there is again, not enough data to confirm.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">The final chapter looked at banter and it was assumed the sisters would use banter more frequently and would be doing so because of the relationship variable. 
			The results of this dissertation illustrated this assumption was wrong. There was only one instance of banter found in the sisters’ conversation and five instances
			found in the students’ conversation. However, an important finding was that the overall lack of politeness found in the sisters’ conversation meant they had an
			emotional intimacy through the relationship variable, compared to the students who had very typical instances of banter.</p>
			
			<p class="main-p">The dissertation has shown that repairs in conversation can be affected by the linguistic variables of age and relationship.  However, the results found are simply not 
			sufficient enough to make a full confirmation.  At times there would only be one example found that was affected by the variable. For future works, having more data and 
			specifically having a conversation where the participants are complete strangers and all of different ages, would provide a more structured argument to show whether or
			not the repair is affected by age and relationship. The data used in the dissertation were simply too specific with what they were set to discuss.  Due to these 
			specific topic discussions, the results became skewed and unreliable.</p>
